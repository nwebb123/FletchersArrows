# Vin Fletcher's Arrows
C# console application to give an estimate for custom arrows made by Vin.  

## Purpose:
Purpose of this application is to practice general programming skills in C#. Inspired by a challenge from the C# Player's Guide, the guidelines are as follows:

- Build a program that will allow the user get an estimate on the cost of an arrow depending on the materials used to make it. 
- The user can select a type of arrowhead material (wood, obsidian, or steel), shaft length (no less than 60cm, no more than 100cm), and fletching material (goose feathers, turkey feathers, or plastic)
- The user is given a cost of how much an arrow will cost depending on the materials chosen and the length of the arrow.
